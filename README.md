# UNO
Phyton OOP Mini-Project
This project is a simple version of the card game known as "UNO".
This has been carried out for evaluative purposes corresponding to the units of git and phyton object-oriented.

# HOW TO PLAY

When starting the program, the user will be asked to enter the number of players and then the names of each one.
If no name is entered, the program will assign Player 1 - Player 4.

To play a card, select the number of the cards you want to play or 0 to take a card from the deck.
In the same way when a wild card is played, the number in front of the color to which you want to change is selected.

When a player has one card left they are given 3 seconds to say "UNO",
the way to do this is to press Ctrl + C before the counter reaches 0.

The game ends when a player says "UNO", when the cards in the deck and discard pile run out, or when a player reaches 500pts.

+2 = 20pts
reverse = 20pts
pass = 20pts
change colors = 50pts
+4 = 50pts
